        <h3>Consistency is wonderful! Intro to why Frameworks are good.</h3>
        <p>VueJS forces everyone to write in the same style of code.</p>
        <p>The code is written in component based architecture.</p>
        <h2>There are a couple of drawbacks, but not insurmountable challenges:</h2>
        <p>Frameworks have a steeper learning curve and you have to know what you're doing to be proficient with them.</p>
        <p>Frameworks have rigid structures, so you must follow the rules of Vue or it will not work!</p>
